# MTG_app

This repository is a little project of mine. I'll develop this application over time and take different approaches on use cases. Probably will focus on secondary market and card related information.

**First approach**

Getting data related to MtG Cards from a second market webshop. Data shall be further used. Test case is printing them to command line.

**Second step**

Test cases are stored in json file for further usage. For now data will be replaced on execution. Further development to adding new information to data.
