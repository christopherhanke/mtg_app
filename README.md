# MTG_app

This repository is a little project of mine. I'll develop this application over time and take different approaches on use cases. Probably will focus on secondary market and card related information.

**First approach**

Getting data related to MtG Cards from a second market webshop. Data shall be further used. Test case is printing them to command line.
